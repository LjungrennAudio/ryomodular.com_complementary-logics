this is a nice friend for the existing ryo ttl logics - but this time theure complementary logics with the appropriate alteratiosnindesign and hence advantages and disadvantages that make em worth having _as well_ as having the existing ttl logics!

they dont have any newly invemted gates or logic options but they do behave differently inc ircumstances that prove interstingn in aa modular environment!
